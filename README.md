Game Play: Match two tiles together by clicking tiles to match. The Game Play will be timed and graded!

Rules: You have to match identical cards. Each click is counted as a move. If your moves are equal to 18 then you will get 3 Stars. If your moves are greater than 18 and less than 25 then you will get 2 Stars. Otherwise, you will get 1 Star. You can restart the game at any stage by clicking the reset button. Let's win this thing!
